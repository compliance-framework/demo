A sudden spike to 1000 orders per hour could indicate either:\n - A legitimate event (unannounced marketing campaign, viral social media post)\n - A security incident (automated bulk purchase bots, credential stuffing attack)\n\nBy monitoring these basic metrics, teams can quickly investigate abnormal patterns and determine if they represent security incidents requiring response."
